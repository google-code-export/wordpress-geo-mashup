Geo Mashup started as an after-hours, "wouldn't it be cool if..." project with one author.
Best practices were not always employed.

Some improvements the author has striven for:

  * Conform to the [WordPress Coding Standards](http://codex.wordpress.org/WordPress_Coding_Standards)
  * Add [Inline Documentation](http://codex.wordpress.org/Inline_Documentation)
  * Research and make good use of WordPress interfaces when they exist
  * Mimic WordPress use, design, and implemenation patterns, especially where they work well
  * Tie as much development work as possible into the Issue Tracker for user participation
  * Stay compatible with the [WordPress minimum requirements](http://wordpress.org/about/requirements/)

It would be great if a list that simple could keep Geo Mashup coherent and progressing toward its goals:

  * Make WordPress into a GeoCMS that one person or a small group can manage
  * Make maps as easy to work with as images

In practice, the survival of the project has demanded that these goals bend to a more practical one:

  * Make Geo Mashup a very flexible, customizable tool the authors can use to keep themselves alive while they work on it
