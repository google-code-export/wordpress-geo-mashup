This plugin lets you save location information with posts, pages, and other [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org) objects.  These can then be presented on interactive Google maps in many ways.

There are often two versions of the plugin available, stable and BETA. The BETA version includes all the stable version features, and also new features that need further testing.

# Features #

Geo Mashup, like WordPress, has a simple interface for basic features, templates for control of output, and APIs for endless customization options.  Some popular features are:
  * Use [Google Maps v3](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/reference) or [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmap.org) as a map provider.
  * Global maps can present your posts in many ways
    * They can show just one category, custom taxonomy term,  or custom post type, for example
    * Clicking on a post marker shows a customizable summary of the post or page in an info window
  * Location can be saved for all post types (including pages) users, and comments
  * A Geo Search widget enables searching for content by distance from a search location
  * Synchronize [Geodata](http://codex.wordpress.org/Geodata) with the Geo location mobile client and other plugins
  * Support for both standard WordPress [shortcodes](http://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode_API) and [template tags](http://codex.wordpress.org/Template_Tags/How_to_Pass_Tag_Parameters) to add maps to your site.
  * Reverse geocoding to fill in address information for locations
  * GeoRSS automatically added to feeds
  * Attach KML files to posts and pages
  * Connect category markers with a colored line

# Comparison to Other Mapping Plugins #

Geo Mashup was one of the earliest WordPress mapping plugins, first released in 2005. Eventually the author began using it for freelance jobs, which he still does. As such Geo Mashup is more tailored to customization and hacking than ease of use, but many user-requested features have been [released](http://code.google.com/p/wordpress-geo-mashup/issues/list?can=1&q=type%3DEnhancement) over the years. Geo Mashup creates three tables to optimize location searches.

It's just crazy how many mapping plugins have sprung up since then. If all those developers had worked together we'd have just a few much better plugins. I've been guilty of not reaching out to other authors. If you are a developer interested in working together for a better WordPress mapping future, contact me via [this site](http://code.google.com/u/@VRBQRl1TDhNFXQB5/) or [my site](http://www.cyberhobo.net/hire-me) and I'll work with you.

# Mashup Ingredients #
Geo Mashup combines [WordPress](http://www.wordpress.org/), [Google Maps](http://maps.google.com), [OpenStreetMap](http://openstreetmaps.org), [GeoNames](http://geonames.org), and [geoPlugin](http://geoplugin.net) to create a [GeoCMS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Geospatial_Content_Management_System) that puts you in control of all your content, including geographic data.

[Donate to GeoNames](http://www.geonames.org/donations.html) if you can. It's one of the few free geocoding services that allows commercial usage, and it's been helping to power Geo Mashup for most of it's life.
